    The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an example of a high-level language; other

    high-level languages you might have heard of are C++, PHP, Pascal, C#, and Java. As you might infer from the

    name high-level language, there are also low-level languages, sometimes referred to as machine languages or

    assembly languages. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in lowlevel languages. Thus,

    programs written in a high-level language have to be translated into something more suitable before they can run.

    Almost all programs are written in high-level languages because of their advantages. It is much easier to program

    in a high-level language so programs take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more

    likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are portable, meaning that they can run on different kinds of

    computers with few or no modifications. The engine that translates and runs Python is called the Python Interpreter.

    There are two ways to use it: immediate mode and script mode. In immediate mode, you type Python expressions into the

    Python Interpreter window, and the interpreter immediately shows the result:
